### Battleship Game Specification in Go

#### Game Rules:
1. The game is played on a 10x10 grid.
2. Each player has a fleet of ships, including one aircraft carrier (5 cells), one battleship (4 cells), one cruiser (3 cells), one submarine (3 cells), and one destroyer (2 cells).
3. Players take turns to guess the coordinates to locate and sink the opponent's ships.
4. The game continues until one player's entire fleet is sunk.

#### Code Structure:
1. **Board Representation:**
   - Create a struct to represent the game board.
   - Use a 2D array to represent the grid. Each cell can be empty, a part of a ship, a hit, or a miss.

2. **Ship Struct:**
   - Create a struct to represent a ship with attributes like length, position, and orientation.

3. **Player Struct:**
   - Create a struct to represent a player with attributes like name, fleet, and a reference to the game board.

4. **Game Logic:**
   - Implement functions for placing ships on the board for each player.
   - Implement a function for taking a shot, updating the board, and checking for hits or misses.
   - Implement a function to check if a player's fleet is completely sunk.

5. **Networking (for LAN play):**
   - Implement a server and client structure for multiplayer functionality.
   - Use Go's `net` package for handling network communication.
   - Define a protocol for exchanging game information between players.

6. **User Interface (for Terminal):**
   - Implement a simple text-based UI for displaying the game board and taking player inputs.
   - Display the state of each cell, indicating hits, misses, and ships.

7. **Scalability for Web-Based Format:**
   - Separate the game logic from the user interface to facilitate future transition to a web-based format.
   - Consider using a web framework like Gorilla Mux for building a web interface.
   - Replace the text-based UI with HTML/CSS for the web version.

#### Example Code (basic structure):

```go
package main

import "fmt"

// Board struct to represent the game board
type Board struct {
    // Define the board attributes
}

// Ship struct to represent a ship
type Ship struct {
    // Define the ship attributes
}

// Player struct to represent a player
type Player struct {
    // Define the player attributes
}

// Functions for game logic, board initialization, placing ships, etc.

func main() {
    // Initialize game, players, and board
    // Start the game loop
    // Implement networking and user interface as needed
}
```
